# ElixirSense

An API/Server for Elixir projects that provides context-aware information for code completion, documentation, go/jump to definition, signature info and more.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/msaraiva/elixir_sense.git
cd elixir_sense
elixir run.exs socket_type port env
```

Where:
- `socket_type` - Can be either `unix` (Unix domain socket) or `tcpip`.
- `port` - Specifies which port number to use. Setting port to `0` will make the underlying OS assign an available port number.
- `env` - The environment. Possible values are `dev` or `test`

Example (using Unix domain socket):

```
$ elixir run.exs unix 0 dev
ok:localhost:/tmp/elixir-sense-some_generated_unique_id.sock
```

Example (using TCP/IP):

```
$ elixir run.exs tcpip 0 dev
ok:localhost:56789:AUTH_TOKEN
```

> Note: AUTH_TOKEN is an authentication token generated by the server. All requests sent over tcp/ip must contain this token.

## Connecting to the server

The TCP server sends/receives data using a simple binary protocol. All messages are serialized into Erlang's [External Term Format](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html). Clients that want to communicate with the server must serialize/deserialize data into/from this format.

### Example using :gen_tcp

```elixir
{:ok, socket} = :gen_tcp.connect({:local, '/tmp/elixir-sense-some_generated_unique_id.sock'}, 0, [:binary, active: false, packet: 4])

ElixirSense.Server.ContextLoader.set_context("dev", "PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT")

code = """
defmodule MyModule do
  alias List, as: MyList
  MyList.flatten(par0,
end
"""

request = %{
  "request_id" => 1,
  "auth_token" => nil,
  "request" => "signature",
  "payload" => %{
    "buffer" => code,
    "line" => 3,
    "column" => 23
  }
}

data = :erlang.term_to_binary(request)
:ok = :gen_tcp.send(socket, data)
{:ok, response} = :gen_tcp.recv(socket, 0)
:erlang.binary_to_term(response)

```

The output:

```elixir
%{request_id: 1,
  payload: %{
    active_param: 1,
    pipe_before: false,
    signatures: [
      %{documentation: "Flattens the given `list` of nested lists.",
        name: "flatten",
        params: ["list"],
        spec: "@spec flatten(deep_list) :: list when deep_list: [any | deep_list]"
      },
      %{documentation: "Flattens the given `list` of nested lists.\nThe list `tail` will be added at the end of\nthe flattened list.",
        name: "flatten",
        params: ["list", "tail"],
        spec: "@spec flatten(deep_list, [elem]) :: [elem] when deep_list: [elem | deep_list], elem: var"
      }
    ]},
  error: nil
}
```

### Example using `elixir-sense-client.js`

```javascript
let client = new ElixirSenseClient('localhost', '/tmp/elixir-sense-some_generated_unique_id.sock', null, "dev", PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT)

code = `
  defmodule MyModule do
    alias List, as: MyList
    MyList.flatten(par0,
  end
`;

client.send("signature", { buffer: code, line: 4, column: 25 }, (result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
```

## Testing

```
$ mix deps.get
$ mix test
```

For coverage:

```
mix coveralls
```

## Credits

- This project probably wouldn't even exist without all the work done by Samuel Tonini and all contributors from [alchemist-server](https://github.com/tonini/alchemist-server).
- The Expand feature was inspired by the [mex](https://github.com/mrluc/mex) tool by Luc Fueston. There's also a very nice post where he describes the whole process of [Building A Macro-Expansion Helper for IEx](http://blog.maketogether.com/building-a-macro-expansion-helper/).
